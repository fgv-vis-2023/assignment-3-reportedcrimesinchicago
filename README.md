# Data Visualization: Assignment 3 - Interactive Design

This is a project developed for the Data Visualization course, taught by professor Jorge Poco, by the students [Bernardo Vargas](https://github.com/), [Cristiano LÃ¡rrea](https://github.com/cristianolarrea) and [Paloma Borges](https://github.com/palomavb), from the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence course at FGV.

We used the data from [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2) and the D3 library to build a visualization that shows the distribution of crime across Chicago.
